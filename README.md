# AGRICULTURE AND FARM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Agriculture and Farm Management System aims to address the challenges faced by farmers by providing them with essential knowledge and resources. Through education and technology integration, the project seeks to empower farmers with information on agricultural practices, requirements, and support services, ultimately enhancing their livelihoods and promoting sustainability in the agricultural sector.


## OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of the of this project are:
- To maintain proper records and manage the details of farmers,plants,soil type and its suitable climatic conditions.

- The degree and depth of the details would be provided based on the user’s expertise in the agriculture sector. 
- If a farmer is well versed and wisely experienced in this field, then giving him all the details wouldn’t be necessary, whereas an amateur would require exactly that.

- Providing the user with the details of the nearest store house for their particular choice of crop.

- Fixing a normalised rate for each crop by different farms from different areas.

- Directing the farmer to the nearest KVK centre for scientific guidance upon request.

- Suggestion of pesticides and manures to be used based on the entered crop type and condition.
